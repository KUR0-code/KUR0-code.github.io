                        - A monitor is obviously what you will be looking at while you play. 
                        So you want it to have fast refresh rates with improved colour accuracy and resolution.

                        <br>
                        - Wireless keyboards are often the most sought-after when considering a gaming setup.
                        The absence of wires makes it look nicer and less cluttered. Also, a good wireless gaming 
                        keyboard is likely to have better response times and no lag.
                        <br>

                        - For your setup, the mouse doesn't necessarily need to be a gaming mouse. It will ultimately be giving you the same service.
                        However, a gaming mouse will often allow for player customisation and will likely have extra buttons to play around
                        with and optimize gameplay.

                        - For starters, you will likely need a phone with high refresh rates. some examples are the Asus ROG Phone 6,
                        Nubia Red Magic 7 and the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel.

                        - You will need to prepare sets of thumb sleeves to ensure that the phone screen will not be disrupted by the perspiration.
