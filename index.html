                                <p>
                                Esports, short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games.
                                Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, 
                                particularly between professional players, individually or as teams.

                                <p>
                                    Esports as we know it today is relatively new, however, competitive gaming has been around since the days of Pong. 
                                    Esports traces its origins back to 1972, when home consoles first became common. In 1980, the first nationwide Space 
                                    Invaders competition was held with 10,000 participants. A year later, gamers competed in the surprisingly cutthroat, 
                                    inaugural Donkey Kong tournament.

                                    The growth of esports has been phenomenal, with new games being launched every year. Some games, however, dominate the 
                                    landscape and are more popular than the others. Such games include <a href="https://www.dota2.com/home" target="_blank">DOTA 2</a>,

                                In esports, your tools are just as critical. Rather than cleats or bats, players' tools for most esports can be boiled down to a handful of key components: 
                                the mouse, mouse pad, keyboard, headset and controller (depending on your chosen Esport).
