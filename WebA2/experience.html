                                Anyone can start an esports team. What you need are a few team members who will most likely be your friends.
                                 However, to have a professional esports team, you must have the right people, and those will most likely not 
                                 be your friends. 
                            </p>

                               Practice makes perfect and team work makes the dream work. Pro players spend hours every single 
                               day to practice and come out with strategies to win the game.

                                A scrim is when a pro or competitive team decides it's time to get out of public matches and head
                                into a true competitive setting against another pro or competitive team to practice.

                            <p>
                                If you want to be a competitive gamer, you're going to need to compete in gaming. 
                                There are plenty of online leagues with amateur levels. Competing in online tournaments 
                                and leagues is a great way to improve your skills and to start getting noticed.

                                <br>
                                As we say, this couldn’t be further from the truth.
                                Just as a sports degree isn’t all about playing football or any other 
                                physical activity, a qualification in esports isn’t just about playing
                                video games.
                                
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The Esports BTEC aims to give students a broad 
                                insight into the different types of roles and areas of the 
                                esports industry, whether that’s coaching, commentary, 
                                management, content creation, events and more.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                However, you can make a comparison with traditional sports. In football,
                                the players are just one aspect of the industry. 
                                There’s a whole plethora of roles and talent across the board 
                                that make that industry what it is, whether it’s journalists, 
                                referees, kit manufacturers, coaches, TV presenters, marketing
                                executives, the list goes on. And the same goes for esports.

                                Like any other sport, esports requires a lot of mental and physical prowess, 
                                rendering it an actual sport. In case you are wondering about the physical part,
                                 you should know that most of the reflexes required to play esports are at an 
                                 inhuman level, and pulling them off demands that your mental and physical strength
                                is up to par.
